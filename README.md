DESCRIPTION:

PressPointe is a very old content management system designed for a local newspaper. It is no longer in use, but I'm keeping it here for posterity. It is more than a decade old and was one of the first full systems I designed in PHP, so it's got a ton of flaws and probably won't run on PHP 7/8.
